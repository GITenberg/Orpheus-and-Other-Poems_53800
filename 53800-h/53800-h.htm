<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unto the realm of Pluto many roads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead with dark winding from the bright abodes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men, and when life’s last detaining thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is cut by Iris, and the body, dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Charon’s coin in palm, rests in the tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on the pyre, the dæmon of its doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After much pitiful forbearance tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul from its environment of cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With promise sweet of love’s awaiting kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old friends greeting, and much holy bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On shores Elysian, where all ways are peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all existence virtue without cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere the fields of Asphodel are won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dire labours manifold must first be done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By soul and dæmon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">All the paths descend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To four great streams, whose turgid waters blend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With suffering souls: here flows sad Acheron<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whose black banks impatient spirits run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call to that grim boatman, ferrying o’er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His last embarker to the nether shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence, bent with duty’s measured pull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certain of all to follow; there, too, full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of awful lamentations from lost souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocytus its fierce waves of sorrow rolls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein dwells one whose face is only seen&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a>{2}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Above the surface, human and serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, her horrid serpent-form encoils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stings the hapless spirits in her toils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorpion venom; Phlegethon rolls by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flaming with waves that hiss, and mount on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lick with burning tongue each crusted shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where not the vilest weed dare clamber o’er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There swim huge salamanders, whose desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows with the maddening tumult of the fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lastly, Styx, that pool of pitchy slime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby the great gods swear their vows sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose black channel hatred finds a home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breeds with fury many a plague-born gnome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loathsome to gods and men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">These rivers run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far to the West, beyond the sinking sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond old Ocean’s limits, past the range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of starry travel or where comets strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush in hot madness; there too Lethe flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where souls must drink to gain the sweet repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all-forgetfulness, before the Fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lose power to plague them, or their bygone states<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunt them like ghosts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">These waters safely crossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plains beneath thick filled with spirits lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avernus meets the view, vast, horrid lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Hades’ entrance; who its waters take,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a>{3}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sicken and die in torture that must rend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With endless tooth, for such death has no end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond Avernus stands the gate of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cerberus to guard its portals well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unto that gate came Orpheus with his lute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose most melodious music had made mute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wailing souls on Acheron’s sad shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And charmed old Charon, as he ferried o’er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of great Apollo in his quest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her whom of all women he loved best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he came fierce Cerberus stood still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed by the magic of the player’s skill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Orpheus went and played, for he knew well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous potency of this great spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would by a pause be broken, and his fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to pass alive the solemn gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roused the Harpies, those most fearful things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heads and breasts of women and the wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of birds, and talons of the lion fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose breath is poison and whose venoms pierce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in man’s soul&mdash;the hags were planning then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foul plots for planting grief in hearts of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stayed stern Nemesis, now poised for flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she in darkness left her mother Night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The three great judges of the soul now paused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In giving sentence, for the music caused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minos and Æacus and Rhadamanthus think<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What change the gods had wrought, that at the brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Tartarus such heavenly sounds should rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the heart upleap and to the eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Communicate swift tears of sudden joy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Jupiter grown mad to let this boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This gold-haired stripling with the silver strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter dark Hades with such sound that brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity to their stern breasts?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">The Gorgons stare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain at Orpheus through their viper-hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sings and heeds them not, and he alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks at them, eye for eye, and not to stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is turned; the Lemures, that spectral swarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fill the space of Hades without form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halt in their wanderings to hear the notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fall as from a thousand song-birds’ throats.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale Death sits sharpening her dart and hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sad dismay the sound that soothes her ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her arm grows powerless&mdash;the black dart falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With echoing clang on Hades’ marbled halls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The triple sisters who turn mad the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With envy, rage, and hatred, and make blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart with judgment false, hear the high strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knowledge of lost joy o’erwhelms their brains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triptolemus stands still with bated breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on his way to that great hall of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where his stern fellow judges sit aghast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still pondering on Orpheus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Now he passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Marsyas, whose love of music great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lured him to challenge for his after-fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laurel-crowned Apollo and his lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore he stayed in the eternal fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Orpheus, passing, played so wondrous well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the flames about him flickered, fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the wretch in peace to hear once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of sound he staked his spirit for.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black Discord in her den of hideous noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew sudden silent, and her breast with joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled, as the gentle tremblings of the lute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found subtle ways to reach her.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Resolute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode Orpheus on his path, and to the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Sisyphus, the stone just at the height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great mountain, ready to roll again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the vale beneath, but that sweet strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held it in place so long as it could reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spot it rested on&mdash;and to beseech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal playing, Sisyphus held high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired arms to Jove as Orpheus passed him by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to the left Ixion ceased to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The endless revolutions of the wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the flaming river, and the fangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of serpents leave him as he, listless, hangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening to such sweet music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a>{6}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
